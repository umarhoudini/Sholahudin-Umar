Insight & Findings
Expenditure by Category
Health and education consistently show higher per capita spending, reflecting essential household needs.

Urban vs Rural Trends
Urban areas have higher per capita expenditure than rural areas, possibly due to cost of living differences and service availability.

Shifting Consumption Patterns
Increasing spending in entertainment and recreation suggests evolving lifestyle priorities, especially among higher-income groups.

AI Support (IBM Granite)
AI models from IBM Granite were used to assist in generating insights and recommendations. All outputs were validated against the original dataset using exploratory data analysis and visualization in Python.
